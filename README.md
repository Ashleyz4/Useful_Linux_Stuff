My main OS is KDE Neon. Most of the stuff placed in here is going to be specific for KDE. Obviously they can be changed easily, but I just thought I'd put this note in here for anyone interested.

### xboxdrv_hlpr
Created for the purpose to help out people who use xboxdrv. <br/> <br/>
Personally, it wasn't detecting my controller correctly, and I had looked on the internet for a very long time to look up a fix. After I found a fix, if I ever changed my usb port for my controller it would change the ID of the controller every time, so I'd have to look for it again. This fixes that by enabling usb searching and finding your controller and it's ID fast. <br/>
This has debugging as-well so if need be, you can create log what it says, and send it back my way in an issue. <br/>
