# Useful_Linux_Stuff
Stuff that I use with Linux that I've made to make things easier for myself.

For anyone curious I run KDE Plasma Neon on 16.04 at latest. Pretty much everything made here will have been tested on there.

### xboxdrv_hlpr: created for the purpose to help out people who use xboxdrv
###### My personal favorite creation I've made on Linux and python both.
xboxdrv doesn't have builtin autodetection, easy selection or vice versa. This is here to help with that <br/>
xboxdrv_hlpr will detect your plugged in USBs and give you an output to select the device you want, to make xboxdrv much easier then it already is and with built in auto-detection in the case that you change USBs. <br/> <br/>
**TESTED ON PYTHON 2.7 and UP** <br/>
